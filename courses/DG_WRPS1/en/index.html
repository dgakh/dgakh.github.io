<h2>About this course</h2>

<p>
This 2-day course is oriented to the issues relating to software performance, platform effect, algorithms and programming languages as well as actions to improve software products. The effect  of software performance on its quality and reliability has also been reviewed.  
</p>

<p>
The course is based on the authorâ€™s 25-year practical experience in developing and optimizing software solutions. The course is the master class on systematization of problems and solutions in the sphere of software performance. The course is intended for programmers and software developers, however, it can be useful for specialist of adjacent spheres such as software architects, managers of IT projects, and QA.
</p>

<p>
This course is aimed to enable the participants to gain knowledge in the following subjects:
<ul>
  <li>Assessment of needs for optimization. Methods of performance evaluation;</li>
  <li>Features of hardware components and their contribution to the performance of applications;</li>
  <li>Features of the operating system components and their contribution to the performance of applications;</li>
  <li>Factors affecting the speed of the algorithms;</li>
  <li>Features of programming languages and their impact on application performance. Comparing the work of codes implemented on C#, Java, and C++.</li>
</ul> 
</p>

<p>
The essential part of the course is labs with code exercises demonstrating practical implementation of optimization. The labs are implemented for the following platforms:
<ul>
  <li>Programming languages: C#, Java, C++;</li>
  <li>Operation systems: Windows, Linux;</li>
  <li>Architectures: .NET Framework, .NET Core, JVM, Native applications;</li>
</ul>

<h2>Course Content</h2>

<h3>Module 1: Introduction</h3>
<p>
The issues of assessing the need for optimization of applications, relevance of optimization to quality, factors affecting performance, performance evaluation methods, and advantages and disadvantages of optimization have been covered.
</p>

<p>
The relation between the processes of optimizing applications with reagard to professional specialization have been covered in this Module.
</p>

<h3>Module 2: Hardware</h3>
<p>
Contribution of hardware components, including CPU, motherboard, chipset, memory, I / O devices, hard disk, graphics system, as well as the data structure of hardware and software level with regard to application performance have been  concerned in this section.
</p>

<p>
The examination of this module takes more time compared with the other modules due to the fact that the hardware is a base element and success in optimization depends on the understanding of hardware functioning.
</p>

<h3>Module 3: Operating Systems</h3>
<p>
The module reviews the contributions of operating system components to the performance of applications, including the different types of operating systems, the implementation of the processes / threads, files, virtual memory, system calls, etc.
</p>

<h3>Module 4: Algorithms</h3>
<p>
This module introduces the contributions of algorithms to the performance. The factors affecting the performance of the algorithms, as well as generalized methods of optimization have been examined, including the contribution of algorithms being the part of other more complex algorithms as well as  the affect  of sorting algorithms.
</p>

<h3>Module 5: Programming Languages</h3>
<p>
Within this module the contributions of programming languages, translation/compilation, runtime environment, language abstraction level to  performance have been discussed, including the differences between performance of programs depending on programming languages ( C#, Java, and C++ ).
</p>

<h3>Module 6: References</h3>
<p>
Additional sources of information such as books and websites have been proposed for further learning.
</p>
